Signal, Videocall Sign Language Interpreter

Signal is a webapp that allows users to videocall each other using a peer to peer connection.
Using a handtracking model, we are able to track the users hand during videocalls.
We then process that image of the users hand using an AI model to convert the sign language into text.

Unfortunately, due to heroku removing its free hosting service our webapp is no longer hosted.

I have saved the functionality of the site onto a powerpoint presentation for your viewing.
